h1. JUnit Asserts and Test extention

Cotta also extends JUnit to make assertion and testing easier.  These are release as <code>cotta-asserts</code> and <code>cotta-testbase</code>.

h1. Cotta Asserts

This is the final product of several attempts, including the one in "DBFixture":http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/DBFIX/Home. It is an extension of the JUnit 4 assertion syntax, into "Fluent Pattern":http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html like FEST-assert:http://fest.easytesting.org/assert/wiki/pmwiki.php but easier to implement and more extendable, IMHO.

h1. Cotta TestBase

Cotta test base is for those who like JUnit 3.8 for its simplicity but wants something extra like
* Use <code>beforeMethod()</code> and <code>afterMethod()</code> to avoid confusion.
* Use <code>beforeClass()</code> and <code>afterClass()</code> for one time setup and teardown for the class
* Use <code>@XXXFixture</code> annotation for one time setup and tear down for the suite
