h2. "Release 2.1.0":https://sourceforge.net/projects/cotta/files/

* Reverted the API change in 2.0.0, so that it matches 1.x releases

through Input.with() and Output.with() method calls  

h2. "Release 2.0.0":https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=171037&package_id=195405&release_id=687194

* Broke the backward compatibility for changing the list method on FileSystem interface
* Fixed the gap on file system controller to invoke read check on all directory reading operations
* Deprecated IoManager and IoProcessor and separated input processing and output processing
* Improved toString so that it shows:
** File or Directory
** Path used to construct the entry
** Cononical path of the current directory if the path is relative path
* Consolidated the API to use list() method to return a listing object to apply filter and ordering on it.
** Deprecated listFile and listDir methods

the behavior is the same as the java.io.File

* Make dir.file and dir.dir support absolute path
* Added parse method on TFile
* Deprecated IoResource in favor of java.io.Closeable
* New static factory factory method, for convenience
* Make factory() public for TEntry, it really sucks when you really needed
