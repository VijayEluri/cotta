h1. About Cotta

Cotta is a very lightweight file system framework that is created to ease the pain of writing an application
that involves file handling:

* Simplifies Java File IO related API
* Greatly enhances the applications testability.
* Provides other file system implementation that can operate on environment like archive file, FTP server, etc.

Simply put, there have been no such library available, and some of us have put up with Java File IO for too long.

For detail about the thoughts behind Cotta, see "Cotta Power":power.html.
